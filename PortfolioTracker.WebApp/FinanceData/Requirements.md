# Requirements Document

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Currency Exchange Rate Management

- The system must provide an interface to retrieve exchange rates for specific currency pairs.
- The system should allow converting amounts between different currencies based on the retrieved exchange rates.

### 1.2 Data Storage and Retrieval

- The system must store historical exchange rate data in a database.
- The system should support querying exchange rates by date, base currency, and target currency.

### 1.3 Data Seeding

- The system requires an initial setup to seed the database with historical exchange rate data.

### 1.4 API Interface

- Provide a well-defined API interface (ICurrencyRateService) for external modules to interact with the currency exchange functionality.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance

- The system must efficiently handle multiple concurrent requests, ensuring fast response times.
- Optimize database queries to minimize latency in retrieving exchange rate data.

### 2.2 Error Handling and Validation

- Implement proper error handling for cases where requested exchange rates are unavailable or invalid currency codes are provided.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 503 Service Unavailable).

### 2.3 Security

- Ensure that API endpoints require authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- Protect sensitive data and implement secure communication channels.

### 2.4 Logging and Monitoring

- Log all API requests and responses for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
- Implement monitoring to track system performance and detect potential issues.

## 3. Data Requirements

### 3.1 Currency Exchange Data Structure

- Store exchange rate data with fields: date, base currency, target currency, and the exchange rate.
- Use a unique key generation mechanism (e.g., AsKey extension method) for efficient lookup.

## 4. API Requirements

### 4.1 Endpoints

- Define endpoints for fetching exchange rates and converting amounts.
- Ensure compatibility with RESTful principles for ease of integration.

### 4.2 Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or excessive usage of the API.

## 5. Scalability and Performance

### 5.1 Database Design

- Optimize database schema for efficient querying based on date, currency pairs.
- Consider caching frequently accessed exchange rates to reduce load on the database.

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Input Validation

- Validate input parameters (currency codes, dates) before processing requests.
- Return meaningful error messages to clients.

### 6.2 Fault Tolerance

- Implement retry logic for failed database queries.
- Handle temporary service outages gracefully.

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Authentication and Authorization

- Enforce authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
- Restrict access to sensitive operations based on user roles.

## 8. Documentation

### 8.1 API Documentation

- Provide detailed documentation for all public API endpoints.
- Include examples of request/response formats.

### 8.2 Internal Code Documentation

- Ensure that the codebase is well-commented and includes comprehensive documentation in-line where necessary.

## 9. Compliance

### 9.1 Data Privacy

- Comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when storing and processing financial data.
- Implement measures to protect personal data if applicable.

### 9.2 Standards

- Adhere to industry standards for currency exchange rate services, ensuring compatibility with widely used formats and protocols.

## Notes

- Additional requirements may be identified as the system evolves or based on specific use cases not covered in this document.
- Further details about the WebApp's functionality can be inferred from its implementation (refer to `FinanceData.WebApp` for more information).
- Considerations for real-time exchange rate updates and external data sources should be addressed during system design.
